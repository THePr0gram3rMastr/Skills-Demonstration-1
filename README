*********COMPILATION INSTRUCTIONS*********

Note that this project makes use of Java Applets, which have been deprecated since JRE 9.

In order to compile and run the project, go to https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jre8-downloads.html and download the appropriate tar.gz compressed archive for your system.

Then, open up Eclipse, go to Preferences -> Java -> Installed JREs and press "Add".

Following this, in the "JRE Home" field, navigate to the location in which the folder you extracted from the compressed archive is located. It should be called "jre1.8.0_241.jre". Open this folder and you will a sub-directory named "Contents". 

Open the "Contents" folder and inside it there will lie a "Home" directory. This is the directory that JRE Home will point to. 

Next, give the JRE a name and press Finish. Make sure the new JRE is selected as the default (It will be ticked).

You can run the application from inside of Eclipse once this is completed.


*********Further Information*********

While I had difficulty implementing collision detection amoung all of the bricks, I attempted to come up with a relatively efficient system for storing the x,y coordinates of every brick. While I was unsuccessful in implementing this system in the primary project, I did infact write an example of it in C++, just to test it out. 

As a result I have left this C++ file along with the project itself. It contains comments explaining how it works and my different reasonings.
